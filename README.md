-these are development notes that are intended for future personal references and public because it seems to motivate me - be warned of grammar errors - contact me through http://www.mikelseverson.com if you want me talk about this project. 

Let's get learning..

This project will serve as a boilerplate for my future node mongo and express API development. The progress will be documented as I progress through the api development course available on frontendmasters.

Below I am going to keep a development journal for this project in order to write a summary of the project, learning process, struggles, and whatever else comes up as I develop it. 

The API will be essentially a server database with authentication that front end applications will use to have data persistence. I would like to learn more about what features 

After completing this boilerplate, I plan on using it to make some much needed improvements to mikelseverson.com. Future project documentation will be available on there. Future tasks will be to create my own boilerplates for angular 1.X (optimized for future upgrade to 2.x), angular 2.x, and react. 

These projects will also be documented and will be used to get as solid of a grasp of the current state of web development so I can learn the tools I need to provide cutting edge technologies for future employers and clients. 

I've certainly have a lot to learn. I love programming, but I want to find what aspects of it bring me the motivation so it's time to analyze the backend and move to the front end, and it's time to start documenting the process. 

1/13 - Project planning and progress through frontendmasters API course

Project planning: First progress through frontendmasters and recreate the API making sure I fully understand how the components interact with each other. Then I'll create an API with mongoose db, authentication, unit testing, and a custom middleware, mixed in with techniques I learn at Prime Academy. I'll then recreate the API customized for my next project (not utilizing the boilerplate) to cement what I've learned.
